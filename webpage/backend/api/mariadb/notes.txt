Here are the steps to create a new MySQL user with full privileges across the board:

Log in to MySQL as a root user:

mysql -u root -p

Create a new user account:

CREATE USER 'newuser'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';

Grant all privileges to the new user:

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'newuser'@'%';

Reload all the privileges:

FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

This will create a new MySQL user with full privileges that can be accessed from any IP/location.
